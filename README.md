# BIM Events World

A 3D globe with upcoming BIM events around the world.

**[bimeventsworld.com](https://bimeventsworld.com)**

Open Sourced.

## Why this exists

BIM events are scattered across dozens of websites, LinkedIn posts, and word of mouth. We wanted a single place where you can see what's happening and where, without having to dig around.

The globe shows events within the next 12 months. Past events are automatically removed. One event per city to keep things readable.

## What it does

- Interactive 3D globe you can spin and click through to explore events
- Table view with search and filtering by format (in-person, online, hybrid)
- Download calendar files to save events
- Share direct links to specific events
- Available in 6 languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Dutch

## Submit an event

There's a submission form on the site that lets you suggest it. You can also open an issue or PR in this repo to add it directly to the [events list](src/data/events.json).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, whether that's improving translations, or fixing bugs. To add events, submit an issue following the template on the [live website](https://bimeventsworld.com).
